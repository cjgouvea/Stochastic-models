# Stochastic-models
Stochastic models created for my graduation project.
It encompasses 6 different types of stochastic models for simulation 
Composite Poisson functions for discrete extreme events
Functions for parameter estimation analytically or through linear regression
Functions form simulation of a number of series of the same model
Plotting functions adapted to plot the random series with the trend
